# Pokemon Searcher
**I created this website so I could easily search and compare multiple pokemon's stat while playing Pokemon. This website pulls information from a RESTful API (PokéAPI) linked to an extensive database detailing everything about the Pokémon main game series. I am also following along a React.js course and implementing React.js functionality to the website for practice**

**Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, React.js, Bootstrap**

### Features ###
